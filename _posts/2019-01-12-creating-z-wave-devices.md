This is an introduction that is going on forever - way longer than it should.

**Please note:** If you installed Minimal Mistakes via the Ruby Gem method, theme files like `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, and `/assets/` will be missing. This is normal as they are bundled with the [`minimal-mistakes-jekyll`](https://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll) Ruby gem.
