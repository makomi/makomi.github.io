I am an electrical engineer from Dortmund [interested]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}) in electronics, system level programming, psychology, politics, and Vipassana meditation.

Currently, I work as an embedded systems engineer at [SOREL](https://sorel.de/) where I perform a mix of maintenance and development programming for solar thermal controls as well as room controllers and support the hardware design.

[Get in touch]({{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}) if you are interested in a collaboration or would like to know more about one of my [projects] or [the topics I write about].
